    Add Patient entity along with its Controller, Repository, and basic operations (POST, GET, DELETE).
    
    This commit introduces the Patient entity class representing patient information, including name, email, CPF, and activity status. Additionally, a PatientController is implemented to handle registration, retrieval, and deletion of patient data. The PatientRepository facilitates database operations for patient entities. Basic CRUD operations (POST for registration, GET for retrieval, and DELETE for deactivation) are implemented and functional.
